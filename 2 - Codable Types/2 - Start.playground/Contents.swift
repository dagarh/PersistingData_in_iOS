/* In Swift, if some object conforms to the "Encodable" protocol then it can be serialized to some common format like JSON or PropertyList(But while encoding everything can be thought of as just a single string). And if some object conforms to "Decodable" protocol then it can be de-serialized back from that common format. And the object which conforms to "Codable" protocol, that object is serializable and de-serializable both.  */

/* Look at the Final Swift file to see the code. */
